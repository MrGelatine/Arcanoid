# Arcanoid
Arkanoid is an arcade video game developed by Taito in 1986. The game is based on Atari's Breakout series. It was her name that became a household word for a class of similar games.

The player controls a small racket platform that can be moved horizontally from one wall to another, substituting it under the ball, preventing it from falling down. The impact of the ball on the brick leads to the destruction of the brick. After all the bricks on a given level are destroyed, there is a transition to the next level, with a new set of bricks. There is also some variety: certain bricks need to be hit several times, sometimes flying enemies appear, from which the ball is repelled, hitting some bricks leads to prize capsules falling out of them - the prize is activated if you catch such a capsule with a racket
